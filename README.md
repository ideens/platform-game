# Project 1: The Batgame

## Brief

---

Design a simple grid-based game using the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS knowledge learned in the first three weeks of the course. The project should be working and playable, involving basic game logic such as winning, losing, and scoring points.

Choices included: space invaders, battleships, frogger, and snake.

## Introduction

---

The Batgame was my first big solo project coding in JavaScript, but given that I have had some experience in the past, I decided to push the boundaries of the brief and create a platform game.

Platform games are a subgenre of action games that involve the player navigating to an end-goal through multiple levels and environments.. Although it would be possible to create such a game using grid-based logic, I instead endeavoured to use HTML5 Canvas to render my game.

Given that Canvas had not been taught in the first three weeks of the course, this project required a great deal of research and extracurricular learning.

## Design

---

Applying a Batman theme to my game would not only increase the appeal due to the character's familiarity and history, but would also employ the concept of a hero's journey; a journey that players are invested in.

Alongside this, I chose to design my game with pixel art, reminiscent of '80s game design, to evoke positive feelings of nostalgia while playing the simplistic yet visually enticing game.
